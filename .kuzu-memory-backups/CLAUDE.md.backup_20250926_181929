# Project Memory Configuration

This project uses KuzuMemory for intelligent context management.

## Project Information
- **Path**: /Users/masa/Projects/managed/kuzu-memory
- **Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Unknown

## Memory Integration

KuzuMemory is configured to enhance all AI interactions with project-specific context.

### Available Commands:
- `kuzu-memory enhance <prompt>` - Enhance prompts with project context
- `kuzu-memory learn <content>` - Store learning from conversations (async)
- `kuzu-memory recall <query>` - Query project memories
- `kuzu-memory stats` - View memory statistics

### MCP Tools Available:
When interacting with Claude Desktop, the following MCP tools are available:
- **kuzu_enhance**: Enhance prompts with project memories
- **kuzu_learn**: Store new learnings asynchronously
- **kuzu_recall**: Query specific memories
- **kuzu_stats**: Get memory system statistics

## Project Context

Lightweight, embedded graph-based memory system for AI applications using cognitive memory models inspired by human memory psychology.

## Key Technologies
- Python
- Kuzu Graph Database
- Cognitive Memory Types: SEMANTIC, PROCEDURAL, EPISODIC, WORKING, SENSORY, PREFERENCE

## Development Guidelines
- Use kuzu-memory enhance for all AI interactions
- Store important decisions with kuzu-memory learn
- Query context with kuzu-memory recall when needed
- Keep memories project-specific and relevant

## Memory Guidelines

### Cognitive Memory Types (Standardized with TypeScript)

- **SEMANTIC**: Store facts, specifications, identity info (never expires)
- **PROCEDURAL**: Store instructions, processes, patterns (never expires)
- **PREFERENCE**: Store team/user preferences and conventions (never expires)
- **EPISODIC**: Store project decisions, events, experiences (30 days)
- **WORKING**: Store current tasks and immediate priorities (1 day)
- **SENSORY**: Store UI/UX observations and system behavior (6 hours)

### Best Practices

- Store project decisions as EPISODIC memories
- Record technical specifications as SEMANTIC memories
- Capture coding patterns as PROCEDURAL memories
- Document user preferences as PREFERENCE memories
- Note current tasks as WORKING memories
- Record UI/UX feedback as SENSORY memories
