# Goals & Vision

## üéØ **Project Vision**

KuzuMemory aims to solve the **persistent memory problem** for AI applications by providing intelligent, project-specific memory that enables AI assistants to maintain context across conversations and learn from interactions.

### **The Problem We Solve**

**AI assistants today are stateless** - they forget everything between conversations:
- No memory of previous interactions
- No understanding of project context
- No learning from user corrections
- No shared knowledge across team members
- Repeated explanations of project setup

**Traditional solutions are inadequate:**
- Vector databases are too complex and expensive
- LLM-based memory requires API calls and is slow
- User-specific memory doesn't work for team projects
- File-based solutions don't scale or integrate well

### **Our Solution**

**KuzuMemory provides intelligent, persistent memory** that:
- Remembers project-specific information across conversations
- Learns from user interactions and corrections
- Shares context across team members via git
- Integrates seamlessly with AI systems
- Works without LLM calls or external APIs

### **3. Project-Centric Model**
- **Project-specific memories** - Not user-specific, but project-specific
- **Git-integrated** - Memories committed and shared with team
- **Team collaboration** - Shared context across all team members
- **Version controlled** - Memory history tracked in git

### **4. Zero-Configuration**
- **Works out of the box** - Sensible defaults for everything
- **Automatic setup** - Self-configuring database and schema
- **Intelligent extraction** - Automatic memory generation from content
- **Smart deduplication** - Prevents duplicate memories

### **5. Universal Integration**
- **Language agnostic** - Works with any programming language
- **AI system agnostic** - Integrates with any AI assistant
- **Platform independent** - Runs on any operating system
- **Simple interface** - Standard CLI commands
