# Archived Documentation - Deprecated 2025-11-15

This directory contains documentation that has been deprecated as of November 15, 2025 (v1.4.47).

## Deprecated Installer Documentation

These files documented the home directory installer approach which was deprecated in favor of the unified installer:

- **HOME_INSTALLATION.md** - Home directory installation guide (deprecated)
- **HOME_INSTALLER_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Home installer implementation details (deprecated)
- **INSTALLER_DEPRECATION_STRATEGY.md** - Strategy for deprecating old installers (completed)
- **INSTALLATION_COMPARISON.md** - Comparison of installation methods (historical reference)

## Replacement Documentation

For current installation documentation, see:

- [README.md](../../../README.md) - Main installation guide with unified installer
- [docs/CLAUDE_SETUP.md](../../CLAUDE_SETUP.md) - Claude Desktop and Claude Code integration
- [docs/MCP_INSTALLATION.md](../../MCP_INSTALLATION.md) - MCP server installation details

## Historical Context

These files were deprecated as part of the v1.4.x documentation cleanup initiative. The installer consolidation happened in v1.3.x, with the unified installer (`kuzu-memory install <system>`) replacing the old approach.

**Current Version**: v1.4.47
**Deprecation Date**: November 15, 2025
**Reason**: Installer consolidation and documentation streamlining
