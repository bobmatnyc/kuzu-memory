- "Navigation Principle" under documentation links
- "Troubleshooting Principle" under operational runbooks

#### 4. Enhanced Production Information
**Strengthened sections**:
- Production Status: Now "🔴 CRITICAL - Production Status v1.1.4"
- Deployment Status: Clear "PRODUCTION BLOCKERS: None"
- Security Standards: Added idempotency and rollback notes
- Performance Standards: Added validation pipeline reference

#### 5. Improved Documentation Navigation
**Before**: Simple bulleted lists
**After**: Hierarchical structure with priorities

- 🔴 CRITICAL - Essential Reading (Start Here)
- 🟡 IMPORTANT - User Documentation (Getting Started)
- 🟢 STANDARD - Developer Documentation (Development)
- 🟢 STANDARD - MCP Testing & Diagnostics
- ⚪ OPTIONAL - Project Planning & Roadmap
- ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Legacy Scripts

#### 6. Enhanced Compliance Certification
**Before**: Simple checklist
**After**: Comprehensive framework

Added:
- Compliance Framework introduction
- ENFORCED/VALIDATED status indicators
- Documentation Standards section
- Project Metadata section with compliance score
- Last Audit and Next Review dates

#### 7. Improved Claude Code Integration
**Changed priority**: From "🎯" to "🟡 IMPORTANT"
**Added**: "Why This Is Important (Not Critical)" explanation
**Enhanced**: Split into important and optional subsections

## Changes by Section

### Sections Added
