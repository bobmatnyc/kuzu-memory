# Project Memory Configuration

This project uses KuzuMemory for intelligent context management.

## Project Information
- **Path**: /Users/masa/Projects/kuzu-memory
- **Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Unknown

## Memory Integration

KuzuMemory is configured to enhance all AI interactions with project-specific context.

### Installation Commands (ONE WAY):
- `kuzu-memory install claude-code` - Install Claude Code integration (MCP + hooks)
- `kuzu-memory install claude-desktop` - Install Claude Desktop integration (MCP only)
- `kuzu-memory uninstall <integration>` - Uninstall integration
- `kuzu-memory remove <integration>` - Alias for uninstall

### Memory Commands:
- `kuzu-memory enhance <prompt>` - Enhance prompts with project context
- `kuzu-memory learn <content>` - Store learning from conversations (async)
- `kuzu-memory recall <query>` - Query project memories
- `kuzu-memory status` - View memory statistics

### MCP Tools Available:
When interacting with Claude Desktop, the following MCP tools are available:
- **kuzu_enhance**: Enhance prompts with project memories
- **kuzu_learn**: Store new learnings asynchronously
- **kuzu_recall**: Query specific memories
- **kuzu_stats**: Get memory system statistics

## Project Context

Lightweight, embedded graph-based memory system for AI applications

## Key Technologies
- Python

## Development Guidelines
- Use kuzu-memory enhance for all AI interactions
- Store important decisions with kuzu-memory learn
- Query context with kuzu-memory recall when needed
- Keep memories project-specific and relevant

## PyPI Publishing
- **PyPI Token Location**: `.env.local` file contains `TWINE_PASSWORD`
- **Publishing Command**:
  ```bash
  source .env.local  # Load TWINE_PASSWORD
  export TWINE_USERNAME=__token__
  python3 -m twine upload dist/kuzu_memory-*.whl dist/kuzu_memory-*.tar.gz
  ```
- Always verify version number before publishing
- Check https://pypi.org/project/kuzu-memory/ after upload

## Memory Guidelines

- Store project decisions and conventions
- Record technical specifications and API details
- Capture user preferences and patterns
- Document error solutions and workarounds
