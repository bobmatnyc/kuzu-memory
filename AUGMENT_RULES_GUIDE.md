# 🎯 Augment Rules for KuzuMemory Integration

**Perfect integration between Auggie and KuzuMemory using proper Markdown rules!**

This guide shows how to use the **correct** Augment rules format (Markdown files) to automatically integrate KuzuMemory with your AI conversations.

---

## 🚀 **What We've Created**

### **✅ Proper Augment Rules (Markdown Format)**

We've created the correct Augment rules as **Markdown files** (not JavaScript):

1. **`AGENTS.md`** - Main project guidelines file
2. **`.augment/rules/kuzu-memory-integration.md`** - Detailed integration rules
3. **`.augment/rules/memory-quick-reference.md`** - Quick reference guide

### **🎯 How It Works**

The rules instruct Auggie to:
1. **Enhance prompts** with project context before responding
2. **Store information** from user conversations automatically
3. **Use CLI commands** directly for all memory operations

## 🎮 **How to Use**

### **Step 1: Rules Are Already Active**
The rules are automatically loaded by Auggie from:
- `AGENTS.md` (main rules)
- `.augment/rules/` directory (specific rules)

### **Step 2: Initialize KuzuMemory**
```bash
kuzu-memory init
```

### **Step 3: Start Using Auggie**
The integration happens automatically! Auggie will:

**For technical questions:**
```bash
# User asks: "How do I structure an API endpoint?"
# Auggie automatically runs: kuzu-memory enhance "How do I structure an API endpoint?" --format plain
# Auggie uses enhanced prompt for response
```

**For project information:**
```bash
# User says: "We decided to use FastAPI for this project"
# Auggie automatically runs: kuzu-memory learn "We decided to use FastAPI for this project" --source ai-conversation --quiet
```

---

## 🔍 **Integration Examples**

### **Example 1: Technical Question**
```
👤 User: "How should I handle database connections?"

🧠 Auggie (behind the scenes):
   1. Runs: kuzu-memory enhance "How should I handle database connections?" --format plain
   2. Gets enhanced prompt with project context (e.g., "This project uses PostgreSQL...")
   3. Responds with project-specific advice

🤖 Auggie: "For your PostgreSQL setup, I recommend using connection pooling with SQLAlchemy..."
```

### **Example 2: Project Information**
```
👤 User: "We're using Redis for caching in this project"

🧠 Auggie (behind the scenes):
   1. Recognizes project information
   2. Runs: kuzu-memory learn "Project uses Redis for caching" --source ai-conversation --quiet
   3. Stores for future context

🤖 Auggie: "Great choice! Redis is excellent for caching. I'll remember this for future questions."

Later...

👤 User: "What caching solution should I use?"

🧠 Auggie (behind the scenes):
   1. Runs: kuzu-memory enhance "What caching solution should I use?" --format plain
   2. Gets enhanced prompt: "What caching solution should I use? [Context: Project uses Redis for caching]"

🤖 Auggie: "Since your project already uses Redis for caching, I recommend continuing with Redis..."
```

---

## 🎯 **Rule Logic**

### **Enhancement Triggers**
Auggie enhances prompts when users ask:
- "How do I..." / "How should I..." / "What's the best way..."
- Questions about implementation, architecture, databases
- Questions mentioning "this project" or "our system"
- Decision-making questions: "Should we...", "Which is better..."

### **Storage Triggers**
Auggie stores information when users mention:
- **Technologies**: "We use...", "This project uses..."
- **Preferences**: "I prefer...", "I like...", "I always..."
- **Decisions**: "We decided...", "We chose...", "Our approach..."
- **Conventions**: "Our team...", "Our convention...", "Our standard..."
- **Corrections**: "Actually...", "That's wrong...", "Let me clarify..."

### **Smart Filtering**
Auggie **doesn't** enhance/store:
- Simple greetings ("Hi", "Thanks", "OK")
- Generic programming questions unrelated to the project
- Personal information not relevant to the project
- Temporary or session-specific information

---

## 🔧 **Commands Used**

### **Enhancement Commands**
```bash
# Basic enhancement (what Auggie runs automatically)
kuzu-memory enhance "user question" --format plain

# Check what context would be added
kuzu-memory enhance "user question" --format json

# Limit context size if needed
kuzu-memory enhance "user question" --max-memories 3 --format plain
```

### **Storage Commands**
```bash
# Store information (what Auggie runs automatically)
kuzu-memory learn "information to store" --source ai-conversation --quiet

# Store with specific source
kuzu-memory learn "user preference" --source user-preference --quiet

# Store with metadata
kuzu-memory learn "technical decision" --metadata '{"type":"architecture"}' --quiet
```

### **Monitoring Commands**
```bash
# Check what's being stored
kuzu-memory recent --format list

# Search for specific information
kuzu-memory recall "database setup"

# View project status
kuzu-memory project
kuzu-memory stats
```

## 🎉 **Benefits**

### **✅ Seamless Integration**
- **Automatic**: No manual commands needed
- **Invisible**: Users don't see the memory operations
- **Fast**: Commands complete in <100ms
- **Reliable**: Continues working even if commands fail

### **✅ Better AI Responses**
- **Project-specific**: Responses tailored to your project
- **Consistent**: Same context across different sessions
- **Learning**: Gets better over time as more context is stored
- **Team-shared**: All team members get the same context

### **✅ Persistent Memory**
- **Git-integrated**: Memories stored in `kuzu-memories/` directory
- **Team-shared**: Commit memories to share with team
- **Project-scoped**: Each project has its own memory
- **Searchable**: Easy to find and review stored information

---

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### **Rules Not Working?**
```bash
# Check if Auggie can see the rules
ls -la AGENTS.md
ls -la .augment/rules/

# Check if KuzuMemory is available
kuzu-memory --help
```

### **No Context Being Added?**
```bash
# Check if memories exist
kuzu-memory stats
kuzu-memory recent

# Add some test memories
kuzu-memory learn "This project uses FastAPI"
kuzu-memory learn "Team prefers pytest for testing"
```

### **Commands Failing?**
```bash
# Test commands manually
kuzu-memory enhance "How do I build an API?" --format plain
kuzu-memory learn "Test memory" --quiet

# Check project setup
kuzu-memory project
```

## 🎯 **Success Indicators**

The integration is working when:
- ✅ AI responses become more project-specific over time
- ✅ You don't need to repeat project context
- ✅ New team members get instant project context
- ✅ Consistent responses across different conversation sessions
- ✅ Memory operations are fast and invisible

---

## 🚀 **Ready to Use!**

### **The rules are already active!** 
Just start using Auggie normally and the memory integration will happen automatically.

### **Test it:**
1. Ask: "How should I structure an API endpoint?"
2. Say: "We're using FastAPI for this project"
3. Ask: "What's the best way to handle database connections?"
4. Check: `kuzu-memory recent` to see what was stored

**The integration should be seamless and invisible - you'll just notice that Auggie's responses become more project-specific over time!** 🎯✨
