# Cognitive Memory Types Migration Complete

## Summary

The KuzuMemory Python implementation has been successfully migrated to use a 6-type cognitive memory system, achieving full compatibility with the TypeScript implementation.

## New Memory Types

| Type | Description | Retention |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **EPISODIC** | Personal experiences and events | 30 days |
| **SEMANTIC** | Facts and general knowledge | Never expires |
| **PROCEDURAL** | Instructions and how-to content | Never expires |
| **WORKING** | Tasks and current focus | 1 day |
| **SENSORY** | Sensory descriptions | 6 hours |
| **PREFERENCE** | User/team preferences | Never expires |

## Key Achievements

1. **Standardization**: Both Python and TypeScript now use the same cognitive memory model
2. **Enhanced NLP**: 146 training examples, sentiment analysis, batch processing
3. **Backward Compatible**: Old types automatically convert to new ones
4. **Full Test Coverage**: All 66+ tests passing
5. **Complete Documentation**: Migration guides, memory type docs, updated README
